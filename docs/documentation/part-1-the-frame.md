# Part 1: The Frame

By using lasercut panels, few extra parts are needed to mount all the hardware together. All stepper motors and linear rails for the Y-axis mount to the top plate, which has all holes already present. This keeps  part count low and makes alignment fairly easy. 

Aluminum frames are easily available and cheap while very rigid, which is the reason they're used as uprights. 

Sources for aluminum extrusions are:

[Motedis](https://www.motedis.com/shop/index.php?language=en), a German supplier of extrusions. Note that they are open about keeping customer service to a minimum, be sure to not make any mistakes when ordering. Cheapest supplier I found. Make sure you get the 'B Type Slot 6' extrusions. They also have stores throughout Europe, shipping prices vary. 

[Dold Mechatronik](https://www.dold-mechatronik.de), another German supplier. Choose 'B Type Slot 6'. Unsure if they ship to other countries.

[Misumi US](https://us.misumi-ec.com) for extrusions in the US, get the 'HFS-5' version. Note that this extrusion requires a M5 tap. 

[Misumi UK](https://uk.misumi-ec.com) for extrusions in Europe, get either 'HFS-5' or 'NFS-5'. This extrusion requires a M5 tap.
